{"id":"zellij-crew-7pk","title":"Fix plugin exit/crash and fill-in mode bugs","description":"Two critical bugs identified during testing:\n\n1. **Plugin keeps exiting** - Log shows repeated 'Bye from plugin X' messages. Plugin loads then exits within seconds. Need to investigate why.\n\n2. **Fill-in mode not working** - When closing 'bob' and creating new tab, got 'Tab #5' instead of 'bob'. Root cause was using tab.position as key, but positions shift when tabs close. FIXED by switching to name-based tracking.\n\nSession context:\n- Switched from lib.rs to main.rs (needed _start export)\n- Added ChangeApplicationState permission for rename_tab\n- Removed set_selectable(false) call\n- Rewrote state tracking to use used_names HashSet instead of assigned_names by position\n\nTesting needed after restart:\n- Verify plugin stays running (no repeated 'Bye' messages)\n- Test fill-in: alice,bob,carol,dave -\u003e close bob -\u003e new tab should be 'bob'\n- Test round-robin: same scenario should give 'eve' not 'bob'","notes":"## Session 2 Debug Analysis\n\n### What was tried\n1. Added pending_rename tracking to break infinite loops - this worked for the loop\n2. Added extensive debug logging to see TabInfo fields\n3. Confirmed TabInfo only has 'position' field, no stable tab ID\n\n### The Real Bug - rename_tab uses wrong index\nFrom log lines 145-166:\n- Had tabs: [alice, carol, Tab #4] at positions [0, 1, 2]\n- Called rename_tab(3) to rename position 2 (Tab #4) to 'bob'\n- Result: position 1 (carol) became 'bob', NOT position 2!\n\nThe rename went to the WRONG tab. rename_tab(3) renamed position 1, not position 2.\n\n### Root cause hypothesis\nAfter closing bob (original position 1):\n- alice stayed at position 0\n- carol MOVED from position 2 to position 1\n- Tab #4 is at position 2\n\nBut rename_tab(3) seems to be using the ORIGINAL tab ordering, not current positions.\nIt renamed 'what was originally tab 3' (carol) instead of 'current position 2' (Tab #4).\n\n### What rename_tab actually does\nThe docs say it takes 'position' but it appears to use some internal tab index/ID that persists across tab closures, NOT the current visual position.\n\n### Possible solutions to investigate\n1. Find if there's a stable tab ID in TabInfo we missed\n2. Track the original 'Tab #N' number and use that for rename_tab\n3. Look at zellij source code to understand rename_tab behavior\n4. Try using the tab NAME pattern ('Tab #N') to derive the index\n5. Focus the tab first, then use rename_tab without index?\n\n### Code state\n- pending_rename tracking works (breaks infinite loop)\n- Debug logging shows full TabInfo struct\n- The +1 indexing is correct for initial tabs\n- Bug only manifests AFTER closing a tab and positions shift","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"karlbunch@karlbunch.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T19:05:45.462298439-05:00","created_by":"Karl Bunch","updated_at":"2026-01-19T19:56:54.416471776-05:00"}
